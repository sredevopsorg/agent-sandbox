# TypeScript Client SDK for Agent Sandbox

This TypeScript client provides a high-level interface for creating and interacting with sandboxes managed by the Agent Sandbox controller, mirroring the [Go client](../../go/README.md) and [Python client](../../python/agentic-sandbox-client/README.md).

The current surface covers the Kubernetes resource layer only: provisioning a `SandboxClaim`, watching it to readiness, and tearing it down (`SandboxClient` / `Sandbox`). Connectivity to the sandbox runtime (running commands, reading and writing files) lands as a follow-up — see [issue #977](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/issues/977).

## Publishing status

This package is **not currently distributed** in any form — there is no npm package and no git-based distribution channel today.
`"private": true` in [package.json](package.json) is set intentionally, as a safeguard against accidentally publishing an unfinished package to the npm registry (e.g. via a stray `npm publish` or an automated release step).
It is still under active development and its public API may change without notice.

## Development / local usage

Until this package is published, use it by checking out this repository and building it locally
from this directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox.git
cd agent-sandbox/clients/typescript/agentic-sandbox-client
npm install
npm run build
```

See [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) for the full set of exports.

## Automatic expiration

Set `shutdownAfterSeconds` when creating a sandbox to have the controller delete
its claim and sandbox after the requested lifetime, even if the client process
exits before cleaning up:

```typescript
import { SandboxClient } from "./dist/index.js";

const client = new SandboxClient();
const sandbox = await client.createSandbox("my-warm-pool", "default", {
  shutdownAfterSeconds: 300,
});
```

The lifetime starts at the `createSandbox` call and includes provisioning time.
The option sets an absolute `spec.lifecycle.shutdownTime` and
`spec.lifecycle.shutdownPolicy: "Delete"` on the claim, matching the Python SDK's
`shutdown_after_seconds`. It must be a positive integer that produces a valid
RFC3339 deadline; invalid values reject with `SandboxError` before provisioning.
Omitting it leaves expiration unset. Continue to call `sandbox.close()` when work
finishes; expiration provides a fallback if the client cannot clean up.
