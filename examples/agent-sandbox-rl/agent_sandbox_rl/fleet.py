"""`SandboxFleet` — the synchronous orchestrator.

Drives the full lifecycle across one or many clusters: load tasks → preflight →
plan (compute replicas) → ensure templates → start warm pools → acquire (claim a
sandbox per task, returning a `SandboxHandle` with a hostname/endpoint) →
release → teardown. Use the primitives directly from an RL loop, or the managed
`run()`. (Strategies + parallelism land in phase 4; async in phase 6.)

    ``recycle`` is an **orthogonal** modifier, not a strategy: with ``recycle=True``
    the chosen ``strategy`` still governs warm-pool sizing/timing, but tasks sharing
    an image reuse one claimed sandbox (git-restore reset between them) instead of a
    fresh claim per task — see `recycle.reuse_git_restore_sandbox`. It only applies
    to workloads with a resettable ``/testbed`` (multiple tasks per image, e.g. RL
