"""Agent Sandbox API constants (v1beta1 / "beta").

The `k8s-agent-sandbox` SDK ships constants for SandboxClaim and Sandbox, but
NOT for SandboxTemplate / SandboxWarmPool (it never creates them). This package
adds those; they are candidates to upstream into the SDK later.

#                 names so runs on the same image never share (or delete) a pool.
