# Sandboxed Tools Example (Go)

This example demonstrates an architectural pattern for AI agents: **launching an Agent Sandbox for tool execution**, keeping the agentic loop itself outside of the sandbox, and reusing a sandbox across multiple tool calls within a session.

By reusing a sandbox and automatically extending its inactivity timeout, we avoid sandbox creation latency on subsequent tool calls, while still ensuring the sandbox is automatically cleaned up when idle.

## Architecture & Key Concepts

1. **Minimal OpenAI-Compatible Client (`pkg/llm`)**: A lightweight Go client built on `net/http` without a third-party OpenAI SDK that interacts with OpenAI-compatible API endpoints (such as the Gemini API via its OpenAI compatibility layer). It supports function calling (tools) and tool call responses.
2. **Pluggable Toolsets (`pkg/toolsets`)**: The tools and the system prompt are bundled into a *toolset*, selected with the `-toolset` flag. A toolset also declares the sandbox image it expects, so switching toolsets switches the whole agent profile. Two toolsets are provided: `basic` (the original minimal tools) and `geminicli` (the [gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) tool surface, reimplemented in Go — see below).
3. **Sandbox Reuse**: The application provisions a sandbox pod on the first tool call of a session, and reuses it for subsequent tool calls. This keeps the execution overhead low.
4. **Session Persistence via Snapshots**: To maintain continuity across conversation turns and protect against inactivity cleanups or CLI restarts:
   - The application automatically snapshots the sandbox's home directory (`/home/clawtainer` by default) after tool executions at conversation boundaries.
   - These snapshots are saved as local tarball files on the host machine under `~/.local/sandboxed-tools/<session>/fs/backup-*.tar.gz`.
   - Only the last 5 backups are retained per session; older backups are automatically pruned.
   - If a session is resumed and the sandbox was cleaned up by Kubernetes (due to inactivity timeout), a new sandbox is created and the latest snapshot is automatically restored before executing the tool.

## Command-Line Arguments (CLI Options)

The application accepts the following command-line flags:

| Flag | Description | Default / Fallback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-session` | **Required**. A unique alphanumeric name (max 40 characters) to identify this agent session and store/restore its filesystem snapshots. | None |
| `-namespace`| The Kubernetes namespace where sandbox pods are created. | `default` (overrides `SANDBOX_NAMESPACE` env var) |
| `-toolset` | The toolset (tools + system prompt) to expose to the LLM: `basic` or `geminicli`. | `basic` (overrides `TOOLSET` env var) |
| `-image` | The container image used for the temporary sandbox pod. Precedence: this flag, then `SANDBOX_IMAGE`, then the toolset's default image, then `debian:bookworm-slim`. | Toolset default |
| `-homedir` | The directory inside the sandbox that is persisted via snapshot/restore. | `/home/clawtainer` (overrides `SANDBOX_HOME_DIR` env var) |
| `-tool-timeout` | Maximum duration a single tool invocation (`run_command`, `ls`, `read`, or `write`) may run before it is cancelled. Accepts Go duration syntax, e.g. `30s`, `2m`, `1h`. `<= 0` disables the timeout. | `2m` |

> **Note:** `-tool-timeout` cancels the Kubernetes exec connection and unblocks the agent loop; it does not guarantee that every process the command started inside the container (e.g. a detached background process) has actually been terminated.

## Configuration

The application is configured via environment variables (usually for API keys and endpoint configuration):

| Variable | Description | Default / Fallback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Gemini API key (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`). | **Required** |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | The base URL for the OpenAI-compatible API. | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai` |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | The model name to use for chat completions (or `MODEL`). | `gemini-3.5-flash` |
| `SANDBOX_IMAGE` | Fallback container image if `-image` flag is not set. | Toolset default |
| `SANDBOX_NAMESPACE`| Fallback Kubernetes namespace if `-namespace` flag is not set. | `default` |
| `SANDBOX_HOME_DIR` | Fallback persisted directory if `-homedir` flag is not set. | `/home/clawtainer` |
| `TOOLSET` | Fallback toolset if `-toolset` flag is not set. | `basic` |

## Toolsets

The tools and the system prompt are pluggable: each *toolset* (`pkg/toolsets`) bundles a system prompt, a set of LLM-callable tools, and the sandbox image those tools need. Select one with `-toolset`.

### `basic` (default)

A minimal, image-agnostic toolset (`pkg/toolsets/basic`) that works on any sandbox image with standard POSIX utilities:

* **`run_command`**: Executes an arbitrary shell command inside the sandbox container, returning `stdout`, `stderr`, and the `exit_code`.
* **`ls`**: Lists the files and directories inside a specific folder (defaults to the current directory).
* **`read`**: Reads the full contents of a file from the sandbox.
* **`write`**: Writes specified content to a file, automatically creating parent directories if they do not exist and overwriting the file if it does.

### `geminicli`

A toolset (`pkg/toolsets/geminicli`) that reproduces the tool surface and system prompt of [gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (Apache-2.0), so models tuned for gemini-cli behave the same way inside an Agent Sandbox. The tools are reimplemented in Go — no Node.js runtime is required in the sandbox:

* **`run_shell_command`**: Executes a bash command (with background-process support via `is_background`).
* **`list_directory`**: Lists a directory (directories first, with sizes and ignore globs).
* **`read_file`**: Reads a file, with `start_line`/`end_line` ranges and truncation hints for large files.
* **`write_file`**: Writes full file content, creating parent directories.
* **`replace`**: Exact-literal-string edits, failing loudly on ambiguous or missing `old_string`.
* **`glob`**: Finds files by glob pattern (`**`, `{a,b}` supported), newest first.
* **`grep_search`**: Regex content search with include globs, context lines, and match caps.
* **`read_many_files`**: Bulk-reads files matching glob patterns into one response.

The filesystem tools are implemented by a small Go helper binary, **`geminicli-toolbox`** (`cmd/geminicli-toolbox` + `pkg/toolsets/geminicli/toolbox`), which runs *inside* the sandbox: the agent execs `geminicli-toolbox <tool-name>` with the tool arguments as JSON on stdin and reads the result from stdout. This keeps tool semantics (glob matching, exact-string edits, truncation) deterministic and fast, without depending on which utilities the base image ships.

The sandbox image for this toolset therefore has to include the `geminicli-toolbox` binary. Build it from the repository root and make it available to your cluster (for kind):

```bash
docker build -t kind.local/geminicli-toolbox:dev -f examples/sandboxed-tools/images/geminicli-toolbox/Dockerfile .
kind load docker-image kind.local/geminicli-toolbox:dev --name agent-sandbox

cd examples/sandboxed-tools
go run ./cmd/sandboxed-tools-cli -session mysession -toolset geminicli -image kind.local/geminicli-toolbox:dev
```

## Fake LLM for Testing

Setting `OPENAI_MODEL=fake-eliza` selects a built-in fake LLM instead of a real API, so the
agent plumbing can be exercised without an LLM API key or LLM endpoint access. The fake answers
every message with a question reflecting the user's words back (`"What is the capital of France?"`
=> `"What do you think it means when you say 'What is the capital of France?'?"`), and knows
one trick for testing the tool path end to end: a message of the form `run: <command>`
makes it request a `run_command` tool call and report the result. Note that the `run:` tool
path still needs Kubernetes connectivity: the command executes in an Agent Sandbox.

## ACP Server (server-side agent)

`cmd/acp-server` is a server-side version of this example: it exposes the same agent loop
over the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (JSON-RPC 2.0 as
newline-delimited JSON over TCP) so that it can run **inside** the cluster, where it creates
Agent Sandboxes for tool execution, while any ACP client drives it remotely — creating
sessions, sending prompts, and approving or rejecting each tool call
(`session/request_permission`).

The server reads the same environment variables as the CLI (see [Configuration](#configuration)),
but in the cluster they come from a Secret named `sandboxed-tools-acp-server` that the
Deployment loads with `envFrom`. The manifest does not create that Secret, so you choose the
model when you create it; the pod waits in `CreateContainerConfigError` until it exists.

**Security.** The server does not authenticate its clients: ACP's `initialize` exchange
advertises no auth methods and the TCP listener is plain text. Anything that can reach it can
create sessions, approve its own tool calls (including `run_command`), run commands in Agent
Sandboxes under the server's RBAC, and spend the API key in the Secret. For that reason the
manifest deliberately creates no Service: you reach the server with `kubectl port-forward` to
the Deployment, so access is gated by your kubeconfig. The pod is still reachable by pod IP
from inside the cluster network, so use a NetworkPolicy if that matters in your cluster. Do
not add a Service, Ingress or Gateway in front of it without an authenticating proxy. Adding
ACP authentication to the server itself is future work.

The walkthrough below deploys to the `default` namespace, which is what the manifest
hard-codes, so every `kubectl` command passes `-n default` explicitly rather than relying on
your context's namespace. To run it elsewhere, edit the `namespace` fields in the manifest and
use that namespace throughout.

### 1. Build the server image

From the repository root, for a kind cluster such as the one `make deploy-kind` creates
(named `agent-sandbox`). The `kind.local/` prefix is not a real registry: the image is
loaded straight into the cluster's nodes, and `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent` uses it from
there.

```bash
export IMAGE=kind.local/sandboxed-tools-acp-server:latest
docker build -t ${IMAGE} -f examples/sandboxed-tools/cmd/acp-server/Dockerfile .
kind load docker-image ${IMAGE} --name agent-sandbox
```

For any other cluster, tag the image for a registry it can pull from and push instead of
loading:

```bash
export IMAGE=<registry>/sandboxed-tools-acp-server:latest
docker build -t ${IMAGE} -f examples/sandboxed-tools/cmd/acp-server/Dockerfile .
docker push ${IMAGE}
```

### 2. Start with the fake LLM (no API key)

`fake-eliza` (see [Fake LLM for Testing](#fake-llm-for-testing)) exercises the whole path:
session creation, prompting, tool permission approval, sandbox creation, and command execution
in the sandbox.

```bash
kubectl -n default create secret generic sandboxed-tools-acp-server \
  --from-literal=OPENAI_MODEL=fake-eliza \
  --from-literal=TOOLSET=basic

# Deploy the server (the manifest reads the image from ${IMAGE})
envsubst < examples/sandboxed-tools/cmd/acp-server/k8s/acp-server.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl -n default rollout status deployment/sandboxed-tools-acp-server
kubectl -n default port-forward deployment/sandboxed-tools-acp-server 8090:8090
```

Then, in another terminal, chat with it using the ACP client example. Try `run: uname -a`:
the fake LLM asks for a `run_command` tool call, the client prompts you to allow it, and the
command runs in a freshly created Agent Sandbox.

```bash
cd examples/agentclientprotocol
go run . -addr localhost:8090
```

### 3. Switch to Gemini

Replace the Secret with a real model and API key, then restart the Deployment so the pod
picks up the new environment (`envFrom` is read at container start):

```bash
kubectl -n default delete secret sandboxed-tools-acp-server
kubectl -n default create secret generic sandboxed-tools-acp-server \
  --from-literal=OPENAI_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash \
  "--from-literal=GEMINI_API_KEY=${GEMINI_API_KEY}" \
  --from-literal=TOOLSET=basic
kubectl -n default rollout restart deployment/sandboxed-tools-acp-server
kubectl -n default rollout status deployment/sandboxed-tools-acp-server
kubectl -n default port-forward deployment/sandboxed-tools-acp-server 8090:8090
```

Reconnect the client as above; the agent now answers with Gemini and still runs its tools in
Agent Sandboxes. Any other variable from the [Configuration](#configuration) table goes in the
same Secret, for example `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for a different OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or
`TOOLSET=geminicli` together with `SANDBOX_IMAGE` pointing at an image that contains
`geminicli-toolbox` (see [Toolsets](#toolsets)). Sandboxes are created in the namespace the
server runs in.

## Running the Example

Make sure your Kubernetes cluster is running and accessible via your active `kubeconfig` context.

```bash
# Set your API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run the chat interface, specifying a session name (from this example's
# directory: it is its own Go module)
cd examples/sandboxed-tools
go run ./cmd/sandboxed-tools-cli -session myfirstsession
```

## Session Persistence, Sandbox Reuse & Inactivity Expiry

We aim to balance **responsiveness**, **resource efficiency**, and **cleanup guarantees**:

### 1. Sandbox Reuse (Fast Execution)
Instead of launching and deleting a sandbox on every single tool call, the application launches the sandbox Pod only on the **first tool call**. For subsequent tool calls within the same session, the application **reuses** the active sandbox directly. This cuts execution overhead down from several seconds to milliseconds, keeping the agent loop incredibly fast.

### 2. Kubernetes-Native Inactivity Expiry
To prevent orphaned containers and resource leaks in your cluster, the application leverages the Sandbox's built-in **Lifecycle Spec**:
- During creation, the sandbox is configured with a 5-minute inactivity lifetime: `Spec.Lifecycle.ShutdownTime` is set to `now + 5 minutes` and `Spec.Lifecycle.ShutdownPolicy` is set to `Delete`.
- Every time a new tool is executed, the application automatically **extends the lifecycle** by updating the sandbox's `ShutdownTime` in Kubernetes to `now + 5 minutes`.
- If no new tool calls are made for 5 minutes (e.g., because the CLI was closed, crashed, or left idle), the **Kubernetes controller automatically terminates the Pod and deletes the Sandbox resource**.

### 3. Resuming & Local Filesystem Backups
- **Message History**: Chat history is saved in real-time to a JSONL file at `~/.local/sandboxed-tools/<session-name>/sessions/latest.jsonl`, and restored automatically on startup.
- **Durable Backups**: After each set of tool executions completes (at conversation boundaries), the filesystem state of `/home/clawtainer` is archived to a local timestamped backup at `~/.local/sandboxed-tools/<session-name>/fs`. If the CLI is later restarted or the sandbox is deleted by Kubernetes due to inactivity, a new sandbox is created and restored seamlessly from the latest local backup on the next tool execution.

## Example Session

```console
================================================================================
Welcome to the Sandboxed Tools example!
Session Name: myfirstsession
Type your message (or '/exit' or '/quit' to quit):
================================================================================

User> Create a greeting file with 'Hello from Sandbox' under my home directory, then list the files there.

Agent> I have created the file `greeting.txt` inside `/home/clawtainer` containing the message 'Hello from Sandbox'.
When I listed the files inside `/home/clawtainer`, I found:
- greeting.txt

User> /exit

# (Later, resuming the same session after the sandbox was deleted)
go run ./cmd/sandboxed-tools-cli -session myfirstsession

================================================================================
Resumed session "myfirstsession" with 4 messages in history:
================================================================================
User> Create a greeting file with 'Hello from Sandbox' under my home directory, then list the files there.
Agent> I have created the file `greeting.txt` inside `/home/clawtainer` containing the message 'Hello from Sandbox'.
When I listed the files inside `/home/clawtainer`, I found:
- greeting.txt

User> Read the greeting file.

Agent> The content of the greeting file is:
Hello from Sandbox
```
